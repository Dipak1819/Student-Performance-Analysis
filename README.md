# Student-Performance-Analysis
#Abstract
This project explores the key factors influencing student performance in Nepalese schools by analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing 6,607 records across 20 variables. The dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes, including socio-economic factors (such as family income and parental education), academic inputs (hours studied, tutoring sessions, and teacher quality), and behavioral factors (motivation level, peer influence, and physical activity). The target variable, Exam Score, serves as the benchmark for evaluating student outcomes.
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights to the Ministry of Education in Nepal, enabling data-driven policy formulation aimed at improving educational outcomes. To achieve this, we employed rigorous data preparation techniques, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Following data preprocessing, machine learning models—specifically Decision Tree and Logistic Regression—were trained and evaluated to predict student performance and uncover critical determinants. The models were chosen based on their interpretability and ability to capture complex interactions between features.
Results from both models revealed that factors such as access to resources, parental involvement, and the presence of learning disabilities significantly impact Exam Scores. The analysis also highlighted disparities in performance based on socio-economic conditions and school proximity, offering insights into areas where targeted interventions could make a meaningful difference.
The findings of this project will be presented to the Ministry of Education to support the development of policies focused on enhancing educational equity and resource allocation. By identifying and addressing key barriers to academic success, this study aims to contribute to long-term improvements in the Nepalese education system, ensuring that students receive the support they need to thrive academically. Through data-driven decision-making, this project underscores the importance of understanding the multi-faceted nature of student performance and leveraging insights to foster a more inclusive and effective learning environment.
